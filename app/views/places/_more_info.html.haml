    %p
      We built this map to connect and promote the tech startup community
      in the Philippines. We've seeded the map but we need
      your help to keep it fresh. If you don't see your company,
      please
      = succeed "." do
        %a{"data-dismiss" => "modal", "data-toggle" => "modal", :href => "#modal_add"} submit it here
      Let's put the Philippines on the map together!
