h3. Geocoding

Manual Geotags
Although automatic geocoding still works based on the address entered, this is still not very accurate when locations are outside the United States.

To ensure accurate geotagging, we've added the option to manually enter the latitude and longitude for an entry. If the Latitude and Longitude fields are left blank, automatic geocoding is used.
